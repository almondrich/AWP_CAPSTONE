1. Advanced Filtering Options
Add date range filters (e.g., start and end dates) to generate reports for a specific period.
Filter by user, department, or item category.
Add a keyword search to filter data dynamically.
Example:

html
Copy code
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="start_date" name="start_date" class="form-control">
</div>
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="end_date" name="end_date" class="form-control">
</div>
2. Charts and Graphs
Include visual representations like bar graphs, pie charts, or line graphs for trends.
For example:
Number of approved/released requisitions over time.
Top 10 most requisitioned items.
Percentage of pending vs. completed requests.
Use a library like Chart.js or Google Charts.

3. Report Summaries
Add summary boxes or highlights at the top of the page:
Total Pending Requests
Total Items Released
Total Stock Added
Highest Requisitioned Item
Example:

html
Copy code
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <div class="card bg-primary text-white">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h4>Total Pending Requests</h4>
                <h2>15</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Add other cards for Released, Approved, etc. -->
</div>
4. Export Options
Add multiple export formats (PDF, CSV, Excel).
Use libraries like TCPDF or DOMPDF for PDF export.
Example:

html
Copy code
<button class="btn btn-danger" id="exportPDF"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Export to PDF</button>
5. Drill-Down Reports
Allow users to click on specific entries (e.g., requisition ID) to view detailed information about that record:
Detailed history of a requisition (status updates, remarks, etc.).
Individual stock addition details for an item.
Example: Create a modal or new page for detailed views.

6. User Activity Log Report
Include a report that tracks user actions (e.g., "User X added stock on [date]" or "User Y approved requisition").
Track which admin modified what and when.
Table Example: activity_logs

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE activity_logs (
    log_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
7. Notifications for Low Stock
Generate a report for low stock levels to help restock items before depletion.
Filter items with quantities below a certain threshold.
8. Trend Analysis
Show trends like:
Frequently requested items in the last 30 days.
Monthly or quarterly stock usage trends.
Example Graph:

A bar chart showing item consumption over months.
9. Stock Audit Report
Compare actual physical stock with recorded quantities.
Highlight discrepancies between system records and real-world counts.
10. Custom Report Builder
Allow admins to dynamically choose fields they want in a report (e.g., "Show Item Name, Quantity, User").
Example:

html
Copy code
<select multiple class="form-control" name="fields[]">
    <option value="item_name">Item Name</option>
    <option value="quantity">Quantity</option>
    <option value="status">Status</option>
</select>
11. Scheduled Reports
Add an option for admins to schedule automatic report generation and send reports via email.
12. Improved Design and Usability
Sticky table headers for better navigation on long tables.
Tooltips for column headers to explain the data.
13. Breakdown by Department/Category
Generate reports grouped by department or item category for easier analysis.
14. Reports for Archived Data
Include reports for archived requisitions or items.
15. Download Logs
Add a report to track who downloaded what report and when.

Yes, I can help implement all those features! Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

Plan for Implementation
To ensure we cover everything systematically:

Enhanced Filters: Add date range filters, keyword search, and category-based filters.
Visuals (Charts/Graphs): Integrate Chart.js for dynamic, interactive graphs.
Summaries/Highlights: Create summary boxes showing key stats.
Export Options: Add buttons for exporting to Excel, CSV, and PDF.
Drill-Down Reports: Allow detailed views of each record using modals or links.
User Activity Log Report: Add a table for activity logs (e.g., who did what).
Low Stock Alerts: Generate a report for items with low stock levels.
Trend Analysis: Use graphs for item usage trends over time.
Stock Audit Report: Compare physical stock with system records.
Custom Report Builder: Allow users to pick fields dynamically.
Scheduled Reports: Provide functionality to auto-generate reports and email them.
Archived Data Reports: Include archived requisitions/items in reports.
Download Logs: Track who downloaded reports and when.
Improved Design: Enhance the UI with modern design principles.
Implementation Timeline
Due to the complexity and scope:

Priority Features (Core functionality):

Enhanced filters, summaries, export options, and improved UI.
Estimated time: 1-2 days.
Advanced Features:

Charts, trend analysis, stock audit, and custom report builder.
Estimated time: 2-3 days.
Optional Features:

Scheduled reports, archived data, and download logs.
Estimated time: 1-2 days.
Requirements
To proceed, I need:

Access to your current database structure (already provided).
Specific design preferences (color scheme, layout style, etc.).
Any additional details for features like scheduled reports (e.g., email integration setup).
Deliverables
You will receive:

Complete PHP Code: For all features with proper comments.
Database Scripts: For any new tables (e.g., activity_logs).
Frontend Enhancements: Improved UI with Bootstrap, Datatables, and Chart.js.
Documentation: Explanation of how the new features work.
